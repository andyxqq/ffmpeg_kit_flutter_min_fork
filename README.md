# FFmpeg Kit Flutter Min Fork

A forked version of the ffmpeg_kit_flutter_min package updated to be compatible with newer Flutter versions.

This package is based on the original FFmpeg Kit by arthenica, with updates to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter SDKs.

## Why This Fork?

The original ffmpeg_kit_flutter_min package (version 6.0.3) was last updated about 19 months ago, which can cause compatibility issues with newer Flutter applications. This fork updates the package to work smoothly with current Flutter versions.

## Usage

This package is intended to be used as a direct replacement for ffmpeg_kit_flutter_min in your Flutter project.
